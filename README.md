## 📖 About The Project

A **Smart Campus Utility Tracker** is a network of connected devices (IoT) that provides real-time data on utility usage. Instead of waiting for a monthly bill to see how much energy or water was used, this system tells campus administrators (or students) exactly **where**, **when**, and **how much** is being consumed instantly.
